# Data Analytics: Unveiling the Cosmos

## Overview
This repository contains the solutions and code implementation for the Data Analytics event titled "Unveiling the Cosmos". The event focuses on analyzing and visualizing exoplanet data captured by NASA, exploring various aspects such as planetary detection methods, physical parameters, feature engineering, and habitability classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "phl_exoplanet_catalog_2019" obtained from the [Planetary Habitability Laboratory (PHL) website](https://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog). The dataset contains information about exoplanets including their physical characteristics, host star properties, and habitability classifications.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset file(s).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the code implementation for each problem statement.
- `reports/`: PDF reports generated from the notebooks, containing detailed solutions, plots, and conclusions.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Instructions for Running the Code
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
4. Open the Jupyter notebooks corresponding to problem statement.
5. Execute the code cells in the notebooks to analyze the dataset, perform visualizations, and build classifiers.
7. View the reports in the `reports/` directory for detailed solutions and conclusions.


## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of exoplanet data using various data analytics techniques. Through visualization, feature engineering, and classification, we aim to gain insights into the characteristics and habitability of exoplanets, contributing to our understanding of the cosmos.
